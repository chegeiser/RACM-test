<p>The California Energy Commission (CEC) adopted and put into effect
the first Building Energy Efficiency Standards in 1978 and has updated
these standards periodically in the intervening years. The Building
Energy Efficiency Standards are a unique California asset that has
placed the state on the forefront of energy efficiency, sustainability,
energy independence, and climate change issues. The standards also have
provided a template for national standards within the United States as
well as for other countries around the globe. They have benefitted from
the conscientious involvement and enduring commitment to the public good
of many persons and organizations along the way. The 2022 Building
Energy Efficiency Standards for residential and nonresidential buildings
development and adoption process continued the long-standing practice of
maintaining the standards with technical rigor, challenging but
achievable design and construction practices, public engagement, and
full consideration of the views of stakeholders.</p>
<p>The revisions in the 2022 Building Energy Efficiency Standards for
residential and nonresidential buildings were conceptualized, evaluated,
and justified through the excellent work of CEC staff and consultants
working under contract to the CEC. Revisions were also supported by the
utility-organized Codes and Standards Enhancement Initiative and shaped
by the participation of more than 150 stakeholders and the contribution
of formal public comments.</p>

<h1 id="abstract">ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>The California Energy Commission's (CEC) <em>2022 Building Energy
Efficiency Standards</em> for residential and nonresidential buildings
allows compliance by either a prescriptive or a performance method.
Performance compliance uses computer-modeling software to trade-off
efficiency measures. Performance compliance is the most popular
compliance method because of the flexibility it provides in the building
design.</p>
<p>Compliance software must be certified by the CEC using the rules
established for modeling software. This document establishes the rules
for creating a building model, describes how the proposed design (energy
use) is defined, explains how the standard design (energy budget) is
established, and reports on the Performance Compliance Certificate. This
document does not specify the minimum capabilities of vendor-supplied
software. The CEC reserves the right to approve vendor software for
limited implementations of what is documented in this manual.</p>
<p>This <em>Single-Family Residential Alternative Calculation Method
Reference Manual</em> explains how the proposed and standard designs are
determined. The explanation for multifamily residential building
proposed and standard designs are described in the <em>Nonresidential
and Multifamily Alternative Calculation Method Reference
Manual.</em></p>
<p>The 2022 compliance manager is the simulation and compliance rule
implementation software specified by the CEC. The compliance manager,
called California Building Energy Code Compliance Residential
(CBECC-Res), models all the regulated energy performance features
affecting the energy compliance of a building.</p>

<h2 id="13-compliance-for-newly-constructed-buildings">1.3 Compliance
for Newly Constructed Buildings</h2>
<p>Compliance for newly constructed buildings requires calculating the
proposed design energy use, the standard design energy use, and the
reference design energy use. There may also be additional internal
calculations to establish the standard design photovoltaics (PV)
requirement and the proposed design PV scaling when target energy design
ratings (EDR) are specified. There are two EDRs that are considered in
the energy budget that are described in more detail in this chapter and
<a href="#15-energy-design-rating">1.5 Energy Design Rating</a>.</p>
<p>The proposed building shall separately comply with the source energy
design rating (EDR1), efficiency energy design rating (Efficiency EDR2),
and total energy design rating (Total EDR2). No tradeoffs are allowed
between EDR1 and EDR2.</p>
<p>Compliance with EDR2 requires meeting two criteria. First, the
proposed design Efficiency EDR2 must be equal to or less than the
standard design Efficiency EDR2. Second, the proposed design Total EDR2
must be equal to or less than the standard design Total EDR2.</p>
<h2 id="14-compliance-for-additions-and-alterations">1.4 Compliance for
Additions and Alterations</h2>
<p>Compliance for additions and alterations requires calculating the
proposed design energy use and the standard design energy budget.</p>
<p>When the energy use of the proposed design is equal to or less than
the standard design, the addition or alteration or both comply with the
standards. The compliance margin is the difference between the standard
design energy use time dependent valuation (TDV) and the proposed design
energy use (TDV). When the compliance margin is zero or greater, the
project complies.</p>
<p>The energy use is expressed in units of thousand TDV (kTDV) per
square foot of conditioned floor area (kTDV/ft^2^) and accounts for
regulated energy end uses, including space heating, space cooling,
ventilation, and water heating. Unregulated energy end uses are not
included, such as interior lighting, appliances, cooking, plug loads,
and exterior lighting. PV generation and flexibility measures, such as
battery storage, have no effect on additions and alterations.</p>
<h2 id="15-energy-design-rating">1.5 Energy Design Rating</h2>
<p>There are two independent EDR metrics based on source energy and TDV.
The EDR metric based on source energy is referred to as <em>EDR1</em>,
and the EDR metric based on TDV is referred to as <em>EDR2</em>. No
tradeoffs are allowed between EDR1 and EDR2.</p>
<h3 id="151-energy-design-rating-1-edr1">1.5.1 Energy Design Rating 1
(EDR1)</h3>
<p>EDR1 is a dimensionless metric based on the hourly source energy
consumption of a proposed or standard design divided by the hourly
source energy consumption of the reference design. EDR1 accounts for the
source energy of all end uses, including space heating, space cooling,
ventilation, and water heating, interior lighting, appliances, exterior
lighting, PV generation and flexibility measures, as well as the
Renewables Portfolio Standards (RPS) and similar obligations.</p>
<p>In addition to efficiency, projects receive EDR1 benefits from
generating renewable energy and shifting energy demand to times when the
utility generates low-carbon electricity. The EDR1 is a way to express
the energy performance of a building using a scoring system where 100
represents the energy performance of a reference design building meeting
the efficiency requirements of the <em>2006 International Energy
Conservation Code</em> (IECC). A lower EDR1 score represents less source
energy use. The proposed building must have an EDR1 score that is equal
to or less than the EDR1 score of the standard design.</p>
<p>The physical bounds for source energy are about 10,500 British
thermal units per kilowatt-hour (Btu/kWh) upper bound (proxy
low-efficiency power plant) and 0 Btu/kWh lower bound (renewable
generation). Delivery losses are the same as the delivery losses used
for TDV.</p>
<p>Avoided source energy from incremental renewable generation varies
based on RPS goals. This source energy is a represented as an RPS
percentage value that increases annually. The avoided source energy can
further vary based on the specific resource used, such as wind, solar or
energy storage.</p>
<p>Natural gas long-run source energy is based on the percentage of
renewable gas used by utilities. Increased use of renewable gas will
decrease the source energy impact of retail natural gas consumption.</p>
<p>Propane long-run source energy does not vary annually because there
are no renewable gas offsets that can be used to support propane. The
long-run marginal source energy of propane is constant and considered to
be the source energy of propane gas. This long-run marginal source
energy is calculated as a direct conversion factor of 100
kBtu/therm.</p>
<p>The hourly source energy determined by the CEC is used to determine
compliance.</p>
<h3 id="152-energy-design-rating-2-edr2">1.5.2 Energy Design Rating 2
(EDR2)</h3>
<p>EDR2 is a dimensionless metric based on the TDV energy consumption of
a proposed or standard design divided by the TDV energy consumption of
the reference design.</p>
<p>The EDR2 is a way to express the energy performance of a building
using a scoring system where 100 represents the energy performance of a
reference design building meeting the efficiency requirements of the
<em>2006 IECC</em>. The EDR2 is similar to the energy rating index in
the <em>2014 Residential Energy Services Network</em> (RESNET) standard.
A score of zero represents a building that has zero-net-energy
consumption based on the TDV energy consumption. By combining high
levels of energy efficiency with renewable energy generating or demand
flexibility measures, a score of zero or less could be achieved.</p>
<p>Buildings complying with the current California Building Energy
Efficiency Standards are more efficient than the 2006 IECC, so most
newly constructed buildings will have EDR2 scores below 100. Buildings
with renewable generation can achieve a negative score. If an EDR2 is
calculated for an older, inefficient home, the score would be more than
100.</p>
<p>The Total EDR2 is composed of two components, Efficiency EDR2 and
PV/flexibility EDR2.</p>
<p>The efficiency EDR2 is based on the energy efficiency features of the
building. PV/flexibility EDR2 includes the effects of the PV system,
battery storage system, precooling, and other demand-responsive
measures. Total EDR2 combines the efficiency EDR2 and PV/flexibility
EDR2 into one final score.</p>
<p>The efficiency EDR2 does not include solar electric generation but
can include a self-utilization credit for batteries. The total EDR2
includes the effects of solar generation and any battery storage beyond
the self-utilization credit.</p>
<h2 id="16-self-utilization-credit">1.6 Self-Utilization Credit</h2>
<p>When a PV system is coupled with a battery storage system, the
software allows a portion of the PV/flexibility EDR2 to be traded
against the efficiency EDR2. This modest credit can be used for
tradeoffs against building envelope and efficiencies of the equipment
installed in the building. More detail is provided in <a
href="#self-utilization-credit">2.1.5.6 Self-Utilization Credit.</a></p>
<h2 id="17-demand-response">1.7 Demand Response</h2>
<p>Appropriate demand response controls allow building operators to
reduce TDV energy by automating the response of a building to changes in
utility costs. Demand response is an increasingly important function as
distributed energy resources become more common, as customers have
access to time-of-use (TOU) electricity rates, and incentive programs
are designed to encourage customers to reduce energy use during peak
demand. Demand response occurs on a range of timescales from seconds to
seasons and represents any demand change in response to grid or economic
needs.</p>
<h3 id="171-precooling">1.7.1 Precooling</h3>
<p>Precooling represents a program where special thermostats in homes
receive signals from the local utility that alter the occupant's normal
behavior to reduce air-conditioning energy consumption during peak
electricity demand periods. The house is precooled to a
lower-than-normal set point in the hours preceding the onset of the peak
and then the thermostat is returned to the normal setting for the peak
period. The thermal mass of the structure and furnishings absorbs the
cooling load as the house warms up, allowing the cooling system to
remain off for most, or all, of the highest peak period hours.</p>
<p>CBECC-Res Precooling simulations alter the thermostat set points only
during daylight hours on days when the average daily outdoor temperature
is greater than 78� F, and the peak hourly TDV values are in the top 20
for the year. On those days, the precooling period thermostat setpoint
depends on the predicted outdoor temperature for the day as plotted in
Figure 1.</p>

<p>The savings due to Precooling are reduced by 70% to account for
occupant behavior that might reduce its effectiveness in real homes.</p>
<h1 id="2-proposed-standard-and-reference-design">2 Proposed, Standard,
and Reference Design</h1>
<h2 id="21-overview">2.1 Overview</h2>
<p>This chapter describes how the EDRs are calculated, how the proposed
design is modeled, and how the standard design is established.</p>
<h3 id="211-energy-design-rating">2.1.1 Energy Design Rating</h3>
<p>A lower EDR1 score represents lower source energy consumption. The
EDR1 score is a metric of the proposed design source energy divided by
the reference design source energy budget. An EDR1 score is calculated
for the proposed design and a second EDR1 score is calculated for the
standard design. The proposed design EDR1 must be equal to or less than
the standard design EDR1.</p>
<p>An EDR2 score of zero represents a building that has zero-net-energy
performance based on the TDV energy consumption, and an EDR2 score of
100 represents a building that is minimally compliant with the 2006
International Energy Conservation Code. The EDR2 score is a ratio of
proposed design TDV budget to reference design TDV budget.</p>
<p>An Efficiency EDR2 and Total EDR2 score are calculated for the
proposed design and a second Efficiency EDR2 and Total EDR2 score are
calculated for the standard design. Compliance with EDR2 requires
meeting two criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Proposed design Efficiency EDR2 must be equal to or less than
standard design Efficiency EDR2. The EDR2 is established by the ratio of
the standard design or proposed design space heating, space cooling,
indoor air quality (IAQ) ventilation, water heating, self-utilization
credit TDV energy consumption, and the reference design TDV energy
consumption of the same end uses.</p></li>
<li><p>Total EDR2 (Efficiency EDR2, plus PV/flexibility EDR2) of the
proposed design must be equal to or less than the Total EDR2 of the
standard design. The Total EDR2 is established by the ratio of the
standard design or proposed design efficiency end uses plus interior
lighting, appliances, cooking, plug loads, exterior lighting, and PV
generation and flexibility measures TDV energy consumption and the
reference design TDV energy consumption of the same end uses.</p></li>
</ul>

required for roofs, and exterior walls. Details about the HVAC and water
heating systems, as well as any solar generation systems and battery
storage, are also defined by the user. The user entries for all building
elements should be consistent with the actual building design. If the
compliance software models the specific geometry of the building by
using a coordinate system or graphic entry technique, the data generated
should be consistent with the actual building design.</p>
<h3 id="213-standard-design">2.1.3 Standard Design</h3>
<p>The standard design building, from which the energy budget is
established, is in the same location and has the same geometry as the
proposed design, except the wall and window areas are distributed
equally among the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, and
west). For additions and alterations, the standard design shall have the
same wall and fenestration areas and orientations as the proposed
building. The details are described below.</p>
<p>The <em>energy budget</em> for the residential standard design is the
energy that would be used by a building similar to the proposed design
if the proposed building met the requirements of the prescriptive
standards. The compliance software generates the standard design
automatically, based on fixed and restricted inputs and assumptions.
Custom energy budget generation shall not be accessible to program users
for modification when the program is used for compliance or when the
program generates compliance forms.</p>
<p>The basis of the standard design is prescriptive requirements from
Section 150.1(c) of the Energy Code, Table 150.1-A. Prescriptive
requirements vary by climate zone. Reference Appendices, Joint Appendix
JA2, Table 2-1, contains the 16 California climate zones and
representative cities. The climate zone is based on the zip code for the
proposed building, as documented in JA2.1.1.</p>
<p>The following sections present the details of how the proposed design
and standard design are determined. For many modeling assumptions, the
standard design is the same as the proposed design. When a building has
special features, for which the CEC has established alternate modeling
assumptions, the standard design features will differ from the proposed
design, so the building receives appropriate credit for its efficiency.
When measures require verification by a Home Energy Rating System (HERS)
rater or are designated as a <em>special feature,</em> the specific
requirement is listed on the CF1R.</p>
<h3 id="214-reference-design">2.1.4 Reference Design</h3>
<p>The reference design is calculated using the same inputs,
assumptions, and algorithms as the standard design except for the
following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Air handler power. The air handler power is 0.8 watts per cubic
feet of airflow per minute (W/CFM).</p></li>
<li><p>Air infiltration rate. The air infiltration rate is 7.2 air
changes per hour at 50 pascals of pressurization (ACH50).</p></li>
<li><p>Cooling airflow. The air handler airflow is 300 cubic feet of
airflow per minute per ton of cooling capacity (CFM/ton).</p></li>
<li><p>Duct R-value. The duct R-value is R-8.</p></li>
<li><p>Duct leakage rate. The duct leakage rate is modeled as a heating,
ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) distribution efficiency of 80
percent.</p></li>
<li><p>Quality insulation installation (QII). QII is modeled as
"Yes."</p></li>
<li><p>Wall construction. Climate Zones 2--15 have 2x4 R-13 walls.
Climate Zones 1 and 16 have 2x6 R-19 walls.</p></li>
<li><p>Roof/ceiling construction. Climate Zones 2--15 have R-30 ceiling.
Climate Zones 1 and 16 have R-38 ceiling. No climate zones include
radiant barriers or cool roofs.</p></li>
<li><p>Raised floor construction. Climate Zones 2--15 have 2x10 R-19
floors. Climate Zones 1 and 16 have 2x10 R-30 floors.</p></li>
<li><p>Slab edge insulation. Climate Zones 1 and 16 include R-10
insulation 24 inches deep.</p></li>
<li><p>Window U-factors. Climate Zones 2--15 have 0.65 U-factor. Climate
Zones 1 and 16 have 0.35 U-factor.</p></li>
<li><p>Window SHGC. All windows have 0.4 SHGC.</p></li>
<li><p>Window area. When the window area is below 18 percent of the
floor area, the reference design has the same area as the proposed
design. Above 18 percent, the reference design has 18 percent.</p></li>
<li><p>HVAC equipment efficiencies. HVAC equipment meets National
Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA) requirements in effect in 2006
such as 78 percent AFUE for gas central furnace, and 13 SEER for central
air conditioning.</p></li>
<li><p>Water-heating efficiency. Water heating modeled as a 40-gallon
storage water with a 0.594 energy factor (EF) if gas or a 0.9172 EF if
electric.</p></li>
<li><p>Appliance and plug-load energy use and internal gains. Energy use
and internal gains for appliance and miscellaneous plug loads are
modeled as specified the ANSI/RESNET/ICC 301-2014 Standard.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="215-photovoltaics-requirements">2.1.5 Photovoltaics
Requirements</h3>
<p>The PV requirements are applicable to newly constructed single-family
residential buildings. PV system details are from PVWatts, which is a
web application developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
See Appendix F for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Design</strong></p>
<p>The standard design PV system (based on California flexible
installation [CFI] assumptions) is sized to generate enough electricity
to offset the entire annual electricity consumption for a mixed-fuel
building that meets all the 2022 prescriptive requirements.</p>
<p>The compliance summary tab in CBECC-Res provides energy consumption
information for the building, including photovoltaic and battery systems
([Figure 2: Energy Use Details]{.underline}).</p>
<p>For PV sizing calculations, the software assumes the CFI orientation
170 degrees, standard efficiency for modules, inverter efficiency of 96
percent, fixed tracking, standard (excluding horizon) shading, roof tilt
of 22.61 degrees (5:12 pitch), and annual solar access percentage of 98
percent.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Design</strong></p>
<p>The proposed PV system is sized to offset the entire annual
electricity consumption of the proposed design.</p>
<p>For PV sizing calculations, the software includes user-defined values
for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Array orientation, including CFI1 (installation of 150--270
degrees, CFI2 (installation of 105-300) or the actual
orientation.</p></li>
<li><p>Module type, including standard (for example, poly- or
monocrystalline silicon modules), premium (for example, high-efficiency
monocrystalline silicon modules with anti-reflective coatings), or thin
film (in other words, low efficiency such as 11 percent).</p></li>
<li><p>Inverter efficiency.</p></li>
<li><p>Array tilt in degrees or roof pitch, or CFI1 or CFI2
(installation up to 7:12).</p></li>
<li><p>Array tracking type including fixed, single-axis tracking, and
two-axis tracking.</p></li>
<li><p>Annual solar access percentage, excluding horizon shading, of the
modules.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The PV size is reported in kWdc.</p>

program to provide the required PV, click the "Use Community Solar"

<h4 id="exceptions-to-the-pv-requirements">Exceptions to the PV
Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>No PV system is required if the solar access roof area (SARA) is
less than 80 contiguous square feet. The SARA of the building is
described in Section150.1(c)14 of the Energy Code.</p></li>
<li><p>No PV system is required when the minimum PV system size
specified by Section150.1(c)14 of the Energy Code is less than 1.8
kW~dc~.</p></li>
<li><p>Buildings with enforcement-authority-approved roof designs, where
the enforcement authority determines it is not possible for the PV
system - including panels, modules, components, supports, and
attachments to the roof structure - to meet the requirements of the
American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), Standard 7-16, Chapter 7,
Snow Loads.</p></li>
<li><p>For buildings that are approved by the local planning department
before January 1, 2020, with mandatory conditions for approval, shading
from roof designs and configurations for steep-sloped roofs, which are
required by the mandatory conditions for approval, shall be considered
for the annual solar access calculations and roof areas that are not
allowed by the mandatory conditions for approval to have PVs shall not
be considered in determining the SARA.</p></li>
<li><p>PV system sizes determined using Equation 150.1-C may be reduced
by 25 percent if installed in conjunction with a battery storage system.
The battery storage system shall meet the qualification requirements
specified in Joint Appendix JA12 and have a minimum usable capacity of
7.5 kWh.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When the solar electric generation system meets one of the
prescriptive exceptions, the standard design is modeled with an
appropriately sized PV system. The proposed design is modeled with a
system size that does not exceed the PV size required by the standard
design.</p>
<h4 id="specifying-target-energy-design-rating">Specifying Target Energy
Design Rating</h4>
<p>The software provides the option of specifying a PV size based on a
user-specified target EDR. When this option is selected, the software
calculates the required PV size based on the following parameters:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The user-defined target EDR2</p>
<ul>
<li>The size of the battery storage system and the battery control
strategy</li>
<li>The proposed annual kWh budget of the building</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="battery-storage">Battery Storage</h4>
<p>Detailed calculations for PV and battery storage are included in
Appendices C and D.</p>
<p>The software provides credit for a battery storage system coupled
with a PV array. If specified, the battery storage size must be 5 kWh or
larger. For Part 6 compliance, PV has no effect on energy efficiency
requirements or the efficiency EDR2 unless a battery storage system is
included, and the self-utilization credit is modeled.</p>
<p>Including a battery storage system allows downsizing the PV system to
reach a specific EDR2 target.</p>
<p>Software includes a checkbox option to allow excess PV generation
credit for above-code programs. This option, combined with a battery
storage system, allows any PV size with full EDR2 credit.</p>
<h4 id="battery-controls">Battery Controls</h4>
<p>The three control options available are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Basic (Default Control). A simple control strategy that provides
a modest credit. The software assumes that the batteries are charged
anytime PV generation (generation) is greater than the house load
(load); conversely, the batteries are discharged when load exceeds
generation. This control strategy does not allow the batteries to
discharge into the grid.</p></li>
<li><p>Time of Use. To qualify for the TOU control, the battery storage
system shall be installed in the default operation mode to allow
charging from an on-site PV system or from the utility grid if a
stand-alone battery storage system. The battery storage system shall
begin discharging during the highest-priced TOU hours of the day, which
varies by time of the year and the local utility. At a minimum, the
system shall be capable of programming three seasonal TOU schedules,
such as spring, summer, and winter. This option allows discharging
directly into the grid.</p></li>
<li><p>Advanced Demand Flexibility Control. To qualify for the advanced
demand flexibility control, the battery storage system shall be
programmed by default as basic control or TOU control, as described
above. The battery storage control shall meet the demand-responsive
control requirements specified in Section 110.12(a). The battery storage
system shall have the capability to change the charging and discharging
periods in response to signals from the local utility or a third-party
aggregator. Upon receiving a demand response signal from a grid
operator, this option allows discharging directly into the
grid.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verification and Reporting</strong></p>
<p>PV required size and battery system storage details are reported as
special features on the CF1R.</p>
<h4 id="self-utilization-credit">Self-Utilization Credit</h4>
<p>The 2022 Energy Code does not allow a tradeoff between the efficiency
EDR2 and the effect of PV on the total EDR2 unless battery storage is
provided. When the PV system is coupled with at least a 5 kWh battery
storage system, the software allows a portion of the PV/flexibility EDR2
to be traded against the efficiency EDR2. A modest self-utilization
credit can be used for tradeoffs against building envelope and
efficiencies of the equipment installed in the building (Table 1). A
checkbox is provided in the software to enable this credit.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the credit is equal to the 90 percent of the
difference between the 2022 and 2016 Standards envelope requirements,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Below-deck batt roof insulation value of R-19 for the 2022
Standards, and R-13 for the 2016 Standard.</p></li>
<li><p>Wall U-factor of 0.048 for the 2022 Standards and U-factor of
0.051 for the 2016 Standards.</p></li>
<li><p>Window U-factor of 0.30 for the 2022 Standards, and window
U-factor of 0.32 for the 2016 Standards.</p></li>
<li><p>In cooling climate zones, window SHGC of 0.23 for the 2022
Standards, and 0.25 for the 2016 Standards.</p></li>
<li><p>QII requirement in the 2022 standards, and no QII requirements in
the 2016 Standards.</p></li>

<h4 id="carbon-dioxide-emissions">Carbon Dioxide Emissions</h4>
<p>For every hour of the year, the software calculates all energy end
uses in the house, including HVAC, water heating, indoor air quality
(IAQ), plug loads, appliances, inside and exterior lighting, and PV
generation. Based on these hourly calculations, the software calculates
photovoltaic electricity generation that serves the house loads (which
reduces the electricity purchased from the grid) and the hourly exports
back to the grid. Next, the software applies source energy factors that
represent the carbon dioxide (CO~2~) generation characteristics of the
grid to the hourly kWh balances to calculate the CO~2~ generation for
each hour of the year. Finally, the software totals the hourly results
to yield the annual CO~2~ emissions in metric tons per year.</p>
<p>The software reports CO~2~ generation for:</p>

<h2 id="22-the-building">2.2 The Building</h2>
<p><strong>Proposed Design</strong></p>
<p>The building is defined through entries for zones, surfaces, and
equipment. Zone types include attic, conditioned space, crawl space,
basements, and garages. The roof is defined as either part of the attic
or part of a cathedral ceiling (also called a <em>rafter roof</em>). The
software models surfaces separating conditioned space from exterior or
unconditioned spaces (such as a garage or storage) as interior surfaces
adjacent to the unconditioned zone. Exterior surfaces of an attached
garage or storage space are modeled as part of the unconditioned
zone.</p>
<p>The input file will include entries for floor areas, wall, door, roof
and ceiling areas, and fenestration and skylight areas, as well as the
water-heating, space-conditioning, ventilation, and distribution
systems.</p>
<p>Each surface area is entered along with performance characteristics,
including building materials, U-factor, and SHGC. The orientation and
tilt (<a href="#figure-4-surface-definitions">Figure 4: Surface
Definitions</a>) are required for envelope elements.</p>
<p>Building elements are to be consistent with the actual building
design and configuration.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Design</strong></p>
<p>To determine the standard design for single-family residential
buildings, the software creates a building with the same general
characteristics (number of stories, attached garage, climate zone) and
with wall and window areas distributed equally among the four cardinal
directions. Envelope and HVAC performance inputs are set to the
prescriptive requirements in Section 150.1(c) and Table 150.1-A for
single-family residential buildings. For additions and alterations, the
standard design for existing features in the existing building shall
have the same wall and fenestration areas and orientations as the
proposed building. The details are below.</p>
<p><strong>Verification and Reporting</strong></p>
<p>All inputs that are used to establish compliance requirements are
reported on the CF1R for verification.</p>
<p><strong>Reference Design</strong></p>
<p>To determine the reference design for single-family residential
buildings, a building with the same general inputs, assumptions, and
algorithms as the standard design building is modeled except for the
following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Duct R-value. The duct R-value is R-8.</li>
<li>Wall construction. Climate Zones 2--15 have 2x4 R-13 walls. Climate
Zones 1 and 16 have 2x6 R-19 walls.</li>
<li>Roof/ceiling construction. Climate Zones 2--15 have R-30 ceiling.
Climate Zones 1 and 16 have R-38 ceiling. No climate zones include
radiant barriers or cool roofs.</li>
<li>Floor construction. Climate Zones 2--15 have 2x10 R-19 floors.
Climate Zones 1 and 16 have 2x10 R-30 floors.</li>
<li>Slab edge insulation. Climate Zones 1 and 16 include R-10 insulation
24 inches deep.</li>
<li>Window U-factors. Climate Zones 2--15 have a U-factor of 0.65.
Climate Zones 1 and 16 have a U-factor of 0.35.</li>
<li>Window SHGC. All windows have 0.40 SHGC.</li>
<li>Window area. When the window area is below 18 percent of the floor
area, the reference design has the same area as the proposed design.
Above 18 percent, the reference design has 18 percent.</li>
<li>HVAC equipment efficiencies. HVAC equipment meets NAECA requirements
in effect in 2006 such as 78 percent AFUE for gas central furnace, and
13 SEER for central AC.</li>
<li>Water-heating efficiency. Water heating modeled as a 40-gallon
storage water with a 0.594 Energy Factor (EF) if gas, or a 0.9172 EF if
electric.</li>

<h3 id="224-air-leakage-and-infiltration">2.2.4 Air Leakage and
Infiltration</h3>
<p>Air leakage is a building-level characteristic. The compliance
software distributes the leakage over the envelope surfaces in
accordance with the building configuration and constructs a pressure
flow network to simulate the airflows between the conditioned zones,
unconditioned zones, and outside.</p>
<h4 id="building-air-leakage-and-infiltration-ach50">Building Air
Leakage and Infiltration (ACH50)</h4>
<p>The airflow through a blower door at 50 pascals (Pa) of pressure
measured in cubic feet per minute is called CFM50. CFM50 multiplied by
60 minutes, divided by the volume of conditioned space, is the air
changes per hour at 50 Pa, called ACH50.</p>
<p>Specific data on ACH50 may be entered if the single-family home or
townhouse will have verified building air leakage testing.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Design</strong></p>
<p>ACH50 defaults to 5 for newly constructed buildings in single-family
houses and townhomes and 7 for all other buildings that have heating and
cooling system ducts, or both, outside conditioned space, and for
buildings with no cooling system. In single-family homes and townhomes
with no ducts in unconditioned space, the default ACH50 is 4.4 and 6.2
for all other buildings.</p>
<p>Specific data on ACH50 may be entered if the single-family home or
townhouse will have verified building air leakage testing. User input of
an ACH50 that is less than the default value becomes a special feature
requiring HERS verification.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Design</strong></p>
<p>The standard design shall have five ACH50 for single-family homes and
seven for other buildings (ducted space-conditioning).</p>
<p><strong>Verification and Reporting</strong></p>
<p>When the user chooses verified building air leakage testing (any
value less than the standard design), diagnostic testing for reduced
infiltration, with details and target values modeled in the proposed
design, is reported in the HERS-required verification listing on the
CF1R.</p>
<h4 id="defining-air-net-leakage">Defining Air Net Leakage</h4>
<p>The compliance software creates an air leakage network for the
proposed and standard design using the building description. Air leakage
is distributed across the envelope surfaces according to the factors in
<a href="#table-2-air-leakage-distribution">Table 2: Air Leakage
Distribution</a>. The air network is insensitive to wind direction. For
buildings modeled with multiple conditioned zones, either a
20-square-foot open door or 30-square-foot open stairwell (in a
multistory building) is assumed between any two conditioned zones.</p>

<h3 id="225-quality-insulation-installation">2.2.5 Quality Insulation
Installation</h3>
<p>The compliance software user may specify quality insulation
installation (QII) for the proposed design as "yes" or "no." The
effective R-value of cavity insulation is reduced, as shown in Table 3
in buildings with no QII. When set to "no," framed walls, ceilings, and
floors are modeled with added winter heat flow between the conditioned
zone and attic to represent construction cavities open to the attic. QII
does not affect the performance of continuous sheathing in any
construction.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Design</strong></p>
<p>The compliance software user may specify compliance with QII. The
default is "no" for QII.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Design</strong></p>
<p>The standard design is modeled with "yes" for verified QII for newly
constructed single-family residential buildings and additions greater
than 700 square feet in all climate zones.</p>
<p><strong>Verification and Reporting</strong></p>
<p>The presence of QII is reported in the HERS-required verification
listings on the CF1R. Verified QII is certified by the installer and
field verified to comply with RA3.5. Credit for verified QII applies to
ceilings/attics, knee walls, exterior walls, and exterior floors.</p>
<p>For alterations to existing pre-1978 construction, if the existing

<p>Table 3 - When a building is modeled with no QII credit, the effect
of insulation is reduced by the values in this table.</p>
<p>Source: California Energy Commission</p>
<h3 id="226-number-of-bedrooms">2.2.6 Number of Bedrooms</h3>
<p><strong>Proposed Design</strong></p>
<p>The number of bedrooms in a building is used to establish the IAQ
mechanical ventilation requirements and determine if a building
qualifies as a compact building for incentive programs. The number of
bedrooms has a direct effect on water heating use.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Design</strong></p>
<p>The standard design shall have the same number of bedrooms as the
proposed design.</p>
<p><strong>Verification and Reporting</strong></p>
<p>The number of bedrooms is reported on the CF1R for use in field
verification.</p>
<h3 id="227-front-orientation">2.2.7 Front Orientation</h3>
<p>The input for the building front orientation is the actual azimuth of
the front of the building. This azimuth will generally be the side of
the building facing the street or where the front door is located. The
orientations of the other sides of a building viewed from the outside
looking at the front door are called front, left, right, back, or a
value relative to the front, and the compliance software calculates the
actual azimuth from this input.</p>
<p>For homes that may be built in any orientation, such as a
subdivision, multiple orientation compliance can be selected for newly
constructed buildings only. When selected the software will model the
building using the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, and
west).</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Design</strong></p>
<p>The user specifies whether compliance is for multiple orientations or
a site-specific orientation. For site-specific orientation, the user
inputs the actual azimuth of the front in degrees from true north.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Design</strong></p>
<p>The compliance software constructs a standard design building that
has 25 percent of the proposed model wall and window areas facing each
cardinal orientation regardless of the proposed model distribution of
wall and window area.</p>
<p><strong>Verification and Reporting</strong></p>
<p>A typical reported value would be "290 degrees." This value would
indicate that the front of the building faces north 70� west in
surveyors' terms. When compliance is shown for multiple orientations,
"all orientations" or "cardinal" is reported as on the CF1R, and the
energy use results are reported for four orientations including north,
east, south, and west.</p>
<h3 id="228-fuel-type">2.2.8 Fuel Type</h3>
<p>For newly constructed single-family residential buildings, the
standard design fuel type is based on the proposed design fuel type. The
user specifies natural gas if available (see Energy Code, Section
100.1[b] for definition of Natural Gas Availability), or propane, if
natural gas is not available. The user also identifies the fuel type for
cooking appliances, clothes dryer, heating equipment, and water-heating
equipment. This specification is to establish the TDV values from
Reference Appendices, Joint Appendix JA3 used by the compliance software
to determine standard and proposed design energy use.</p>
<p>For projects with a run scope of "addition alone," natural gas is
available if a gas service line can be connected to the site without a
gas main extension. Natural gas is considered available for additions or
alteration projects or both if a gas service line is connected to the
existing building.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Design</strong></p>
<p>The user specifies either natural gas, or propane.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Design</strong></p>
<p>The standard design assumptions for space heating are as defined in
<a href="#241-heating-subsystems">2.4.1 Heating Subsystems</a>, and
those for water heating are defined in <a
href="#29-domestic-hot-water">2.9 Domestic Hot Water (DHW)</a>..</p>
<h3 id="229-attached-garage">2.2.9 Attached Garage</h3>
<p>The user specifies whether there is an attached garage. The garage
zone is modeled as an unconditioned zone (<a
href="#28-garagestorage">2.8 Garage/Storage</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Design</strong></p>
<p>The user specifies whether there is an attached unconditioned space
or garage.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Design</strong></p>
<p>The standard design has the same assumption as the proposed
design.</p>
<p><strong>Verification and Reporting</strong></p>
<p>Features of an attached unconditioned space that affect compliance
are reported on the CF1R.</p>
<h3 id="2210-lighting">2.2.10 Lighting</h3>
<p>The details of the calculation assumptions for lighting loads
included in Appendix E are based on the Codes and Standards Enhancement
(CASE) report on plug loads and lighting (Rubin 2016, see Appendix
F).</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Design</strong></p>
<p>Fraction of portable lighting, power adjustment multiplier, and the
exterior lighting power adjustment multiplier (watts/ft^2^ -- watts per
square foot) are fixed assumptions.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Design</strong></p>
<p>The standard design lighting is set equal to the proposed design
lighting.</p>
<p><strong>Verification and Reporting</strong></p>
<p>No lighting information is reported on the CF1R for compliance with
Title 24, Part 6.</p>
<h3 id="2211-appliances">2.2.11 Appliances</h3>
<p>The details of the calculation assumptions for appliances and plug
loads contained in Appendix E are based on the Codes and Standards
Enhancement (CASE) report on plug loads and lighting (Rubin 2016, see
Appendix F).</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Design</strong></p>
<p>All buildings with kitchens are assumed to have a refrigerator,
dishwasher, and cooking appliance. Optionally, buildings can have a
clothes washer and clothes dryer in the conditioned space. The user can
select fuel type as gas or electric for the clothes dryer and cooking
appliance.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Design</strong></p>
<p>The standard design appliances are set equal to the proposed
appliances.</p>
<p><strong>Verification and Reporting</strong></p>
<p>No information for the appliance types listed above is reported on
the CF1R for compliance with Title 24, Part 6.</p>
<h2 id="building-materials-and-construction">Building Materials and
Construction</h2>
<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<p>Only materials approved by the CEC may be used in defining
constructions. Additional materials may be added to the compliance
manager through an exceptional method application, as outlined in
Section 10-109(e) and Section 10-110.</p>
<p><a href="#table-4-materials-list">Table 4</a> shows a partial list of
the materials available for construction assemblies.</p>
<p><strong>Material Name</strong></p>
<p>The material name is used to select the material for a

<p><strong>Thickness</strong></p>
<p>Some materials, such as three-coat stucco, are defined with a
specific thickness (not editable by the compliance user). The thickness
of other materials, such as softwood used for framing, is selected by
the compliance user based on the construction of the building.</p>
<p><strong>Conductivity</strong></p>
<p>The conductivity of the material is the steady-state heat flow per

<h3 id="construction-assemblies">Construction Assemblies</h3>
<p>"Constructions" are defined by the compliance software user to
characterize the envelope performance of the building. The user
assembles a construction from one or more layers of materials, as shown
in <a href="#figure-5-example-construction-data-screen">Figure 5:
Example Construction Data Screen</a>. For framed constructions, there is
a framing layer that has parallel paths for the framing and the cavity
between the framing members. The layers that are allowed depend on the
surface type. The compliance manager calculates a winter design U-factor
that is compared to a construction that meets the prescriptive standard.
The U-factor is displayed as an aid to the user. The calculations used
in the energy simulation are based on each layer and framing rather than
the U-factor.</p>

<p><strong>Assembly Types</strong></p>
<p>The types of assemblies are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Exterior wall.
<ul>
<li>Interior wall.</li>
<li>Underground wall.</li>
<li>Attic roof.</li>
<li>Cathedral roof.</li>
<li>Ceiling below attic.</li>
<li>Interior ceiling.</li>
<li>Interior floor.</li>
<li>Exterior floor (over unconditioned space or exterior).</li>
<li>Floor over crawl space.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Construction Type</strong></p>
<p>The types of construction are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Ceiling below attic (the roof structure is not defined here, but
is part of the attic), wood-framed. In a residence with a truss roof,
the ceiling is where the insulation is located, while the structure
above the ceiling is encompassed by the term "attic" or "roof." The
attic or roof consists of (from inside to outside) the radiant barrier,
below-deck insulation, framing, above-deck insulation, and the roofing
product, such as asphalt or tile roofing. See more in <a
href="#262-ceiling-below-attic">2.6.2 Ceiling Below Attic</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cathedral ceiling (with the roof defined as part of the assembly),
wood-framed. Since there is no attic, the roof structure is connected to
the insulated assembly at this point.</li>
<li>Roof, structurally insulated panels (SIP).</li>
<li>Walls (interior, exterior, underground), wood- or metal-framed, or
SIP.</li>
<li>Floors (over exterior, over crawl space, or interior).</li>
<li>Party surfaces separate conditioned space included in the analysis
from conditioned space not included in the analysis. Party surfaces for
spaces not included in the analysis include spaces joining an addition
alone to the existing dwelling. Interior walls, ceilings, or floors can
be party surfaces.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Construction Layers</strong></p>
<p>All assemblies have a cavity path and a frame path.</p>
<p>As assemblies are completed, the screen displays whether the
construction meets the prescriptive requirement for that component.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Design</strong></p>
<p>The user defines a construction for each surface type included in the
proposed design. Any variation in insulation R-value, framing size or
spacing, interior or exterior sheathing, or interior or exterior finish
requires the user to define a different construction. Insulation
R-values are based on manufacturer-rated properties rounded to the
nearest whole R-value. Layers such as sheetrock, wood sheathing, stucco,
and carpet whose properties are not compliance variables are included as
generic layers with standard thickness and properties.</p>
<p>Walls separating the house from an attached unconditioned attic or
garage are modeled as interior walls with unconditioned space as the
adjacent zone, which the compliance manager recognizes as a "demising
wall." Floors over a garage are modeled as an interior or demising
floor. The exterior walls, floor, and ceiling/roof of the garage are
modeled as part of the unconditioned garage zone.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Design</strong></p>
<p>The compliance software assembles a construction that meets the
prescriptive standards for each user-defined construction or
assembly.</p>
<p><strong>Verification and Reporting</strong></p>
<p>All proposed constructions, including insulation, frame type, frame
size, and exterior finish or exterior condition, are listed on the CF1R.
Nonstandard framing (for example, 24" on center wall framing, advanced
wall framing) is reported as a special feature.</p>
<h3 id="233-spray-foam-insulation">2.3.3 Spray-Foam Insulation</h3>
<p>The R-values for spray-applied polyurethane foam (SPF) insulation
differ depending on whether the product is open cell or closed cell.
Spray-foam insulation R-values are calculated based on the nominal
thickness of the insulation multiplied by the default thermal
resistivity per inch, or the total R-value may be calculated based on
the thickness of the insulation multiplied by the tested R-value per
inch as certified by the Department of Consumer Affairs, Bureau of
Household Goods and Services. (See details <a
href="#233-spray-foam-insulation">2.3.3 Spray-Foam Insulation</a> and
